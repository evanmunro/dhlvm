\description{
Matrix of respondent counts. Rows are 479 months from January 1978 to November 2017. 
Columns are 1053 permutations of eight questions from the survey of consumers: 
PAGO, PEXP, PX1Q1, DUR,  BUS12, BUS5, UNEMP, and GOVT in the codebook. 
Each question has possible responses 1,3,5 and 8. This derived from the raw data 
by mapping response code 9 to 8, 2 to 1, and 4 to 5. Permutations with less than 38
respondents across all years are dropped to reduce 65,536 possible permutations to 
1,053.
