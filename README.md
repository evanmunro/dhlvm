### Estimation and Analysis of LDA-E and LDA-DE Models for Categorical Survey Data

The package contains code to estimate and analyze LDA-E and LDA-DE models, which are bayesian hierarchical latent variable models for analyzing categorical survey data. 

Installation is through the R package `devtools`:

```
devtools::install_github("evanmunro/dhlvm")
```

For example code that applies both models to analyze data from the Michigan Survey of Consumers and the NLSYM can be found at the following repository [lda-survey-exp](https://www.github.com/evanmunro/lda-survey-exp).
