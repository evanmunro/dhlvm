### Estimation and Analysis of LDA-S and LDA-DS Models for Categorical Survey Data

The package contains code to estimate and analyze LDA-S and LDA-DS models, which are bayesian hierarchical latent variable models for analyzing categorical survey data. 

Installation is through the R package `devtools`:

```
devtools::install_github("evanmunro/dhlvm")
```

A simple vignette which describes the basic functionality of the package is here [TBD]. 

Additional scripts that apply both models to analyze data from the DHS, Michigan Survey of Consumers, and the NLSYM can be found at the repository [hlvm-survey-paper](https://www.github.com/evanmunro/hlvm-survey-paper).
