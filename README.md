### A Dynamic Hierarchical Latent Class Model for Categorical and Mixed Survey Data

The package contains static and dynamic versions of the hierarchical latent class model describe in Munro and Ng 2019.

Installation is through the R package `devtools`:

```
devtools::install_github("evanmunro/dhlvm")
```

Example code for estimating and analyzing the static model, using DHS survey data can be found at TBD repository for the paper.

Example code for the dynamic model, using the Bank of England inflation attitudes survey data, is at TBD repository.  

Example code incorporating mixed and continuous categorical data is at TBD.
